## What Was Completed

### Site Navigation (All Pages)

- Reviewed the top-level navigation, which originally displayed each link in its own paragraph.
- Determined that this structure did not clearly communicate that the links belonged together.
- Reorganized the navigation into a list so the grouping and relationship between links is clear and consistent across all pages.

---

### HTML Timeline (intro.html)

- Reviewed the timeline section that listed important dates as separate paragraphs.
- Determined that the content represented a sequence of related events.
- Reorganized the timeline into a list format that better communicates chronological order and improves readability.

---

### Doctype Grouping (syntax.html)

- Examined the section describing the three different doctypes and their examples.
- Determined that the content represented a grouped set of related items.
- Reorganized the doctypes into a list so the relationship between each doctype and its example is clearer.

---

### HTML Terms (reference.html)

- Reviewed the section containing HTML terms and their descriptions.
- Determined that the content represented paired terms and explanations.
- Reorganized the section into a list format that clearly associates each term with its description.

---

## Purpose of These Changes

These updates were made to:

- Improve the clarity of grouped information
- Make related content easier to scan and understand
- Ensure the structure of the content matches its meaning

Overall, the site content is now better organized, easier to read, and more aligned with semantic best practices for structured information.
